# **TECHNOLOGIES USED**

<br>

# **INSTALL**
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Build a React Application: PLAN

Step 1: Break the UI into a Component Hierarchy. Each component = Parent, Child, Sibling

Step 2: Build a Static Version in REACT.

Step 3: Identify the Minimal (but complete) representation of UI state

Step 4: Identify where your State should live.

Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow : Let’s think about what we want to happen. We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input. 


with the root project folder open in your code editor, execute the following in your terminal:

``cd ProjectName``

``npm install``

``npm start``
